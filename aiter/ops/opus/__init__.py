"""opus kernel Python user-facing API; a16w16 today, a8w8 in follow-ups.

Public API: `gemm_a16w16_opus` (CSV lookup + C++ heuristic) and
`opus_gemm_a16w16_tune` (id-based binding). On unsupported arch the
two callables become stubs that raise RuntimeError on invocation, so
`import aiter` keeps working alongside its 30+ other ops.
